## About me
I worked on a variety of sequence generative modeling and protein property prediction tasks that culminated in my doctoral thesis titled ["Modern Machine Learning Methods for Protein Design"](/assets/dissertation.pdf). I was advised by [Richard Bonneau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bonneau) and [Kyunghyun Cho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyunghyun_Cho) at [NYU](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/about/) in the Computer Science department of the Courant Institute. 

Most of my PhD work stems from my time at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design), where I was a founding member (employee #1) from the early startup days through the acquisition by and integration into Genentech/Roche. Prior to Prescient/NYU I worked in the Systems Biology group, at the time led by Dr. Bonneau, and worked closely with the protein structure/function outfit including [Vlad Gligorijević](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/vladimir-gligorijevic), [Julia Koehler Leman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yo3WJjUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Doug Renfrew](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/douglas-renfrew/).

Before that, I completed an accelerated Master's at [UVM](https://www.uvm.edu/) in computer science advised by [James Bagrow](https://bagrow.com/) with work on understanding causal attribution networks.
